AI Output Consultation

Clarity. Integrity. Human Trust.

AI systems are producing text, images, and interfaces that look correct — but quietly distort meaning.

I help identify when AI output:

introduces subtle errors

misrepresents numbers or facts

garbles text in images

creates false confidence

or breaks trust without obvious failure


This is not prompt tuning.
This is output judgment.

What I Do

I provide human-in-the-loop evaluation for AI-generated output, including:

🔍 Output Review

Text (documents, captions, instructions)

Images containing text (posters, comics, dashboards, slides)

AI-assisted interfaces or reports


🧭 Failure Diagnosis

Semantic drift (“almost right” but wrong)

Number and formatting errors

OCR / image-text corruption

Misleading clarity or tone

Context loss across AI steps


📜 Written Assessment (Optional)

What’s broken

Why it matters

Who could be misled

What to change (or whether to discard)



---

What This Is Not

❌ Not model fine-tuning

❌ Not automation consulting

❌ Not branding or copywriting

❌ Not “AI hype optimization”


This is trust repair.

When You Should Reach Out

You should request a consultation if:

The output will be seen by others

The stakes are non-trivial (money, safety, reputation, policy, education)

Something “feels off” but you can’t pinpoint it

You don’t want to explain an AI mistake after the fact


If it’s harmless, I’ll tell you.
If it’s risky, I’ll explain why.

How It Works

1. Send the Output

Image, text, or link



2. Context Matters

What was it for?

Who is expected to trust it?



3. I Review

Human judgment, not automation



4. You Get a Clear Answer

Safe / Unsafe / Misleading / Needs Revision

Pricing

Initial triage: Free (brief, honest signal)

Written assessment: Case-by-case

Ongoing review / advisory: Available


If you’re not sure what you need, that’s fine.
That’s the point of consultation.

AI doesn’t fail loudly.
It fails convincingly.

That’s what I’m here to catch.
